# A Welder Nerd

Andy's portfolio site using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) in  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Local Preview Mode

If you have Docker and VS Code installed, opening this repository in VS Code should ask if you want to reopen in container. This will give you a Linux environment where the Jekyll engine can run. VS Code will also spellcheck your work.

You must install all recommended extensions for these features to work. Then, invoke the VS Code action "Jekyll: Jekyll Start" to see your site in the default browser.

To publish, just create a new commit and push your changes to GitHub.
